# loggingApplication

Getting familiarized with java servlet.

As, part of the process. Made a small application which allows user to type in the credentials. If the given credentials are correct user will be able to navigate to the home page or a home dashboard page.
Similarly, if the given credentials are wrong the user will be prompted with an error message on the login page to try again.

Currently, I have only one set of credentials.
Username: admin
password: admin1234

Used: Maven for dependency management and tomcat7 to run the application.

Scope of the project: Going to develop a CRUD applicaion.
